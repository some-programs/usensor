# usensor

a simple tool to graph some libsensors temps and fans,, I just made it to tweak some fan settings because I could not find anything good enough for simple real time monitoring.. It's not really polished to a great end user experience or aimed at being run constantly so it propably needs more work if you want to run it like that.
It's linux only and you need libsensors development headers to link against...
